# garden
a garden-simulator using cellular automata, written using pygame.

## To Run:

`python ./src/main.py`

`S` - sand
`W` - water
`R` - rock
`F` - fire
`C` - reset


## Features:

- sand
- water
- rocks
- fire

## To Do:

- water + fire = steam (travels up and condenses)
- coal (same as sand but flammable)
- sand + fire = glass (same as rock but different color)
- rock + fire - lava (flows like water but cools eventually)
- implement sinking without loss of volume


- optimize the rendering
- rewrite core loop
